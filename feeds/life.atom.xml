&lt;p&gt;The drawers are no longer organized. I always fold my clothes and put them in a drawer; but when I can't find
a pair of shorts I need for the gym, I'm unfolding a stack of shirts in the process.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take everything out of the dresser at once. I find some shorts I forget about. I'm excited to wear them again. I try a new folding method and everything is beautifully folded on the bed. I'll have so much more space in my drawers now. I reorganize the drawers. The athleisure should obviously all be in the same drawer. I finally know where everything is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months later, the tidiness will fade. I'll have to reorganize again. For me, the reorganization is the easy part. The hard parts are:
making sure I have the right dresser to hold all of my clothes and having the effort to properly fold and put away my clothes over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Bring back print menus</title><link href="https://www.massover.com/bring-back-print-menus.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-10-27T07:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-10-27T07:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Joshua Massover</name></author><id>tag:www.massover.com,2021-10-27:/bring-back-print-menus.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Print menus are great.

When I load a menu from a QR code, I often get a pdf. I find a pdf awkward to navigate. It's not even the

&lt;p&gt;I'll always remember waking up after a long night out. After all of my friends split, I could finally be myself. I knew what I wanted.
but the options at 3 am are never the best. I'd wake up the next morning telling myself, "I'll never do that again. That pizza was terrible.". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was comfortable. But the thoughts always remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would happen if I told my family? Will they be upset that they could have been eating cheesy scrambled eggs for breakfast this whole time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like cheese, but not all cheese, and that's ok.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry></feed>
