Title: Reorganizing my clothing

Every few months I need to reorganize my clothing.

The drawers are no longer organized. I always fold my clothes and put them in a drawer; but when I can't find
a pair of shorts I need for the gym, I'm unfolding a stack of shirts in the process.  

I take everything out of the dresser at once. I find some shorts I forget about. I'm excited to wear them again. I try a new folding method and everything is beautifully folded on the bed. I'll have so much more space in my drawers now. I reorganize the drawers. The athleisure should obviously all be in the same drawer. I finally know where everything is.

A few months later, the tidiness will fade. I'll have to reorganize again. For me, the reorganization is the easy part. The hard parts are:
making sure I have the right dresser to hold all of my clothes and having the effort to properly fold and put away my clothes over time.
