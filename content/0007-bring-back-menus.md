Print menus are great. A lot of effort and thought usually goes into the menu organization and presentation. 
When I load a menu from a QR code, I often get a pdf. I find a pdf awkward to navigate. It's not even the
bad menu user experience that I care about the most. I just want one less excuse to open my phone.

Bring back print menus.
