Title: I Like Cheese

As far as I can remember, I didn't eat cheese. I said I didn't like it.

I'll always remember waking up after a long night out. After all of my friends split, I could finally be myself. I knew what I wanted.
but the options at 3 am are never the best. I'd wake up the next morning telling myself, "I'll never do that again. That pizza was terrible.". 

I was comfortable. But the thoughts always remain.

What would happen if I told my family? Will they be upset that they could have been eating cheesy scrambled eggs for breakfast this whole time?

Change is difficult.

I like cheese, but not all cheese, and that's ok.
